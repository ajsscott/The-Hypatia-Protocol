# Maintenance Protocol

**Purpose**: Unified maintenance, health verification, and cleanup operations for the Nathaniel ecosystem.
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-25
**Trigger Keywords**: maintenance, cleanup, health check, prune, integrity, housekeeping

---

## Overview

This protocol covers cross-cutting maintenance that no single protocol owns: integrity verification, growth management, and coordinated cleanup across Memory, Intelligence, and supporting files.

**Relationship to Other Protocols**:
- `memory-protocol.md` owns memory CRUD operations and pruning rules (retention thresholds, PRUNE-CHECK/EXECUTE)
- `learning-loop.md` owns pattern/knowledge consolidation and index sync validation (Step 9)
- `CRITICAL-FILE-PROTECTION.md` owns safety rails for destructive operations
- This protocol orchestrates across all of them and adds integrity/growth coverage

**Principle**: This protocol does not duplicate rules defined elsewhere. It references them. If a retention threshold lives in memory-protocol.md, this protocol calls it, not redefines it.

---

## Trigger Conditions

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `maintenance` or `health check` | Run HEALTH-CHECK (non-destructive) |
| `full maintenance` or `deep cleanup` | Run HEALTH-CHECK + CLEANUP-EXECUTE |
| `integrity check` | Run HEALTH-CHECK Part 1a only |
| `cleanup` | Execute cleanup on previously identified issues |
| Save command Part 7 | PRUNE-CHECK runs automatically (per memory-protocol.md) |
| Monthly (first session of month) | Proactive offer: "Monthly maintenance due. Run health check?" |

---

## Part 1: HEALTH-CHECK

**Purpose**: Non-destructive audit of ecosystem state. Reports issues, changes nothing.
**When**: On trigger, monthly proactive, or before any cleanup operation.

### 1a. Integrity Verification

Verify index-to-data sync across all four data stores:

**Patterns**:
1. Collect all IDs from `patterns-index.json` byCategory, byTag, byConfidence, summaries
2. Collect all IDs from `patterns.json` entries
3. Compare: flag IDs in index but not data (phantom), IDs in data but not index (unindexed)
4. Check for duplicate IDs in data entries
5. Verify `stats.totalPatterns` matches actual unique entry count in both index and data files
6. Verify byConfidence and byCategory arrays have no duplicate IDs

**Knowledge**:
1. Same comparison: `knowledge-index.json` vs `knowledge.json`
2. Verify stats match actual counts
3. Check for duplicate IDs

**Reasoning**:
1. Same comparison: `reasoning-index.json` vs `reasoning.json`
2. Verify stats match actual counts
3. Check for duplicate IDs
4. Verify byType arrays reference valid reasoning IDs
5. Verify byProvenance counts sum to total entries (recorded + synthesized + cross_session = total). Absence of provenance field on an entry counts as "recorded".

**Memory**:
1. Compare `memory-index.json` summaries keys vs `memory.json` memories keys
2. Verify stats match actual counts
3. Check byTag arrays reference valid memory IDs

**Sessions**:
1. Compare `session-index.json` entry IDs vs actual `session-*.md` files in Memory/
2. Flag: index entries with no corresponding file
3. Flag: files within 30-day window with no corresponding index entry (pre-index-era files are expected to lack entries)
4. Check ID format consistency (all should use `session-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` format)

**Cross-References**:
1. Collect all source IDs from `cross-references.json` references keys
2. Verify each source exists in `patterns.json` or `knowledge.json`
3. Collect all reasoning IDs from all `referenced_by` arrays
4. Verify each reasoning ID exists in `reasoning.json`
5. Flag orphaned references (source or reasoning entry missing)
6. If `cross-references.json` missing: rebuild from `reasoning.json` derived_from fields (recovery path)

**Vectorstore**:
1. Check if `vectorstore/config.json` exists (vectorstore is optional)
2. If exists: read entry count from `vectorstore/metadata.json`
3. Compare entry count against sum of patterns + knowledge + reasoning entries
4. Flag drift if counts don't match (run `kb_sync.py` to resolve)
5. Verify model version in `config.json` matches `MODEL_NAME` in `kb_vectorize.py`
6. If vectorstore missing: note as INFO, not error (system degrades gracefully to CSR-only)

### 1b. Growth Assessment

Report current sizes against budgets. Budgets defined here are monitoring thresholds for this protocol's reporting only. Retention and pruning rules remain owned by `memory-protocol.md`.

| Resource | Budget | Metric | Source of Truth |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| memory.json | 2,500 lines | `wc -l` | This protocol |
| patterns.json entries | 300 max | Unique entry count | This protocol |
| knowledge.json entries | No cap (monitor) | Entry count | This protocol |
| reasoning.json entries | No cap (monitor) | Entry count | This protocol |
| Session log files (active) | 30-day window | File count outside window | memory-protocol.md |
| Session index entries | 60-day window | Entry count outside window | memory-protocol.md |
| session-archive.json | 200 entries | Entry count | This protocol |
| active_projects | 15 active max | Count where status=active | This protocol |
| Vectorstore entries | Match source stores | Entry count vs sum of stores | This protocol |
| Vectorstore disk | 2MB | `du -sh vectorstore/*.npy *.json` | This protocol |
| Model cache (`/tmp/fastembed_cache/`) | Active model only | Count of cached models | This protocol |
| Total KB disk | 5MB | `du -sh` | This protocol |

**Budget Rationale**:
- memory.json 2,500 lines: Realistic ceiling based on current structure (60 memories, 20+ projects, commitments, proactive behavior, plus transient sections). Raised from 2,000 after 4 months of validated growth.
- patterns 300: System healthy at 246 after 4 months. Consolidation of similar patterns keeps quality high. Raised from 200.
- knowledge: No cap. More knowledge is more knowledge. Quality gates at write time (confidence thresholds, dedup checks, taxonomy sweep) prevent junk. CSR and vectorstore handle retrieval at any scale. Monitor count for awareness, not restriction.
- reasoning: No cap. Same rationale as knowledge. Quality over quantity enforced at write time, not by budget. Target 2-5 per session max still applies as a write-time guideline.
- session-archive.json 200: Beyond this, the archive itself needs pruning or compression
- active_projects 15: More than this means stale projects aren't being archived
- Total KB 5MB: Git performance degrades, clone times increase

### 1c. Staleness Detection

Additionally, check for entries with `_needs_trim: true` flag in patterns.json, knowledge.json, and reasoning.json. These are entries that exceeded content length targets at write time and need condensing.

| Check | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Active projects not touched 90+ days | Flag as stale | Report for user decision |
| Completed/dropped projects older than 14 days | Flag for archive | Report for cleanup |
| Memories not accessed 90+ days | Flag for review | Report for cleanup |

**Saved query shortcuts** (via kb_query.py or MCP kb_search):
- `--saved stale-high-confidence` — high confidence entries not accessed in 90+ days
- `--saved never-accessed` — entries with zero access count
- `--saved low-confidence` — entries below 0.5 confidence
- `--saved refinement-candidates` — L1 entries with accessCount >= 3 (should be L2 but confidence too low)
- `--saved confidence-outliers` — low confidence but high access count (frequently used but untrustworthy)

### 1d. Health Report Format

```

```

---

## Part 2: CLEANUP-EXECUTE

**Purpose**: Fix issues found by HEALTH-CHECK.
**When**: After HEALTH-CHECK reports issues, with user confirmation.
**Safety**: All operations follow CRITICAL-FILE-PROTECTION.md. Read before write. Confirm before delete.

**Destructive Action Gate**: Every step in Part 2 modifies state. Before each step, execute the Destructive Action Gate from Nathaniel.md: IDENTIFY what's changing, RECALL what's established, VERIFY current state (read the file), ALIGN with spec, DECIDE.

### Execution Order

Run cleanup operations in this specific order to prevent cascading issues:

1. **Integrity fixes** (fix data first, before pruning)
2. **Session archival** (move files, update index)
3. **Memory pruning** (clean transient data from memory.json)
4. **Project archival** (move completed projects)
5. **Growth reduction** (if still over budget after 1-4)
6. **Vectorstore sync** (reconcile with source stores after any data changes)
7. **Orphan detection** (only if explicitly requested)
8. **Verification pass** (re-run integrity check to confirm clean state)

**Rollback**: If any step fails mid-execution, STOP. Do not proceed to the next step. Note what completed and what didn't in the session log. Re-run HEALTH-CHECK to assess current state before retrying. For file moves, check both source and destination to determine which files moved successfully.

### 2a. Integrity Fixes

**DESTRUCTIVE**: Modifies patterns.json, patterns-index.json, knowledge.json, knowledge-index.json, reasoning.json, reasoning-index.json, session-index.json.

**Duplicate IDs in data files (patterns.json, knowledge.json, or reasoning.json)**:
1. Read both duplicate entries fully
2. Keep the more recent (by lastUpdated), merge any unique tags from the older
3. Remove the older entry
4. Update corresponding index file to remove duplicate references
5. Recount and update stats in both data and index files

**Phantom index entries** (in index, not in data):
1. Remove the ID from all index arrays (byCategory, byTag, byConfidence, summaries, recentIds)
2. Recount and update stats

**Unindexed data entries** (in data, not in index):
1. Add the entry to appropriate index arrays based on its category, tags, and confidence
2. Recount and update stats

**Stats mismatches**:
1. Recount actual unique entries in data file
2. Update stats in both data and index files to match

**Session ID format normalization**:
1. For index entries without `session-` prefix, prepend it
2. Verify the corrected ID matches an actual file
3. If no matching file exists, remove the index entry

**Index rebuild** (when issues are too numerous to fix individually):
- Reference `learning-loop.md` Step 9 (Sync Validation Gate) for the rebuild procedure
- Rebuild index from data file entries, regenerating all routing arrays

### 2b. Session Archival

**DESTRUCTIVE**: Moves files, modifies session-index.json, modifies session-archive.json.

Execute per `memory-protocol.md` PRUNE-EXECUTE rules:

1. Identify session log files older than 30 days (not already in Memory/archive/)
2. Move files to `Memory/archive/`
3. For each moved file, check if its ID exists in session-index.json
4. If yes and entry is older than 30 days: remove from session-index.json
5. If file had no index entry: no index action needed
6. For files that had index entries: add fingerprint to session-archive.json if not already present
7. Update session-index.json stats

**Minimum keep**: Per memory-protocol.md, always retain at least 10 entries in session-index.json regardless of age.

**Pre-index-era files** (files that predate the session-index system): Archive normally. These files won't have index entries to remove.

### 2c. Memory Pruning

**DESTRUCTIVE**: Modifies memory.json.

Execute per `memory-protocol.md` Retention Rules. Do not invent new thresholds. The authoritative rules are:

| Section | Rule (per memory-protocol.md) |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| pattern_detections | consolidated=true AND older than 30 days, min keep 5 |
| confidence_events | Older than 30 days, keep min 5 most recent |
| offer_history | Older than 60 days, keep min 10 most recent |
| session_metadata | Reset to current session if stale |

### 2d. Project Archival

**DESTRUCTIVE**: Modifies memory.json.

1. Identify projects where status is `complete`, `completed`, or `dropped` AND last_touched is 14+ days ago (per memory-protocol.md retention rules)
2. Move to `projects_archive` array in memory.json (create if doesn't exist)
3. Remove from `active_projects` array
4. Update memory-index.json if any project-related memories affected

### 2e. Growth Reduction

**DESTRUCTIVE**: Modifies memory.json, potentially patterns.json, knowledge.json. Requires user confirmation before executing.

Only runs if memory.json is still over the 2,000-line budget after steps 2c and 2d.

1. **Memories**: Identify memories not accessed in 90+ days with confidence < 0.8 (per memory-protocol.md Monthly Review). Present list to user for confirmation before archiving.
1b. **Memory Confidence Decay**: Entries with `accessCount == 0` and `created > 180 days`: reduce confidence by 0.05 (floor: 0.7), flag as `_stale_candidate` for review.
2. Archive confirmed memories (mark `archived: true`), update memory-index.json

If patterns.json over 200 entries:
1. Identify patterns with confidence < 0.5 AND not accessed in 60+ days
2. Present list to user for confirmation
3. Archive low-value patterns, update patterns-index.json

If knowledge.json quality review needed (periodic, not budget-triggered):
1. Identify entries with confidence < 0.7 AND not accessed in 60+ days
2. Present list to user for confirmation
3. Archive confirmed entries, update knowledge-index.json

If reasoning.json quality review needed (periodic, not budget-triggered):
1. Identify entries with confidence < 0.7 AND not accessed in 60+ days
2. Present list to user for confirmation
3. Archive confirmed entries, update reasoning-index.json

### 2f. Vectorstore Sync

**DESTRUCTIVE**: Modifies vectorstore files (vectors.npy, metadata.json, config.json).

Run after any data changes (integrity fixes, pruning, archival) to keep vectorstore in sync with source stores.

| Scenario | Command | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| After maintenance | `cd hypatia-kb/vectorstore && .venv/bin/python3 kb_sync.py` | Incremental, fast |
| Entry count drift after sync | `cd hypatia-kb/vectorstore && .venv/bin/python3 kb_vectorize.py` | Full rebuild |
| Model changed | `cd hypatia-kb/vectorstore && .venv/bin/python3 kb_vectorize.py` | Full rebuild required |

**Cache cleanup** (if model was changed):
```bash
# List cached models
ls /tmp/fastembed_cache/
# Remove non-active models (keep only the one matching MODEL_NAME in kb_vectorize.py)
rm -rf /tmp/fastembed_cache/models--<non-active-model>
```

**Benchmark after model upgrade**: Run `python3 kb_benchmark.py` first. See `vectorstore/BENCHMARK.md` for protocol.

### 2g. Orphan Detection and Cleanup

**Only runs if explicitly requested.** Not part of standard maintenance.

### 2h. Verification Pass

After all cleanup operations:
1. Re-run HEALTH-CHECK Part 1a (integrity verification)
2. Re-run HEALTH-CHECK Part 1b (growth assessment)
3. Confirm all issues resolved
4. Report final state vs. pre-cleanup state

---

## Part 3: Cadence and Automation

### Automated (Every Save)

Save command Part 7 runs PRUNE-CHECK per memory-protocol.md. This covers retention-based pruning only (session archival, detection cleanup, offer history). Save command Part 3d runs vectorstore sync (kb_sync.py) to keep semantic search current. Neither runs integrity checks or growth assessment. Those require explicit triggers.

**Known risk**: PRUNE-CHECK can be skipped during save if the checklist item is marked without execution. If health check reveals overdue pruning, that indicates save-time pruning has been skipped.

### Monthly Proactive (First Session of Month)

Wired in `Nathaniel.md` Proactive Action Types table (always-loaded context):
- **Trigger**: Session Start + date is 1st-3rd of month
- **Action**: Offer "Monthly maintenance due. Run health check?"
- **Confidence**: 0.9 (time-based, high reliability)
- **Counts toward**: Max 3 proactive offers per session

### Intelligence System Health (Monthly, part of health check)

```
[ ] Schema conformance spot-check: run validate-schemas.py (scripts/validate-schemas.py).
    If errors found, run normalize-schemas.py. If only warnings, classify manually.

[ ] Confidence decay + staleness review (combined single pass):
    Entries with accessCount == 0 and created > 180 days:
    - Reduce confidence by 0.05 (floor: 0.7 for knowledge, 0.5 for patterns/reasoning)
    - Flag as _stale_candidate
    - Knowledge: re-validate against current docs/APIs
    - Patterns: check if behavior still applies
    - Reasoning: check if derived_from sources still valid
    Action per entry: re-validate (update lastAccessed), archive, or delete.
    **If deleting**: Execute Removal Cascade (intelligence-operations.md Part 7b).

[ ] Tag health: check singleton tag rate. If above 40%, run tag consolidation
    (merge singletons into semantically equivalent common tags, update synonym-map).

[ ] Access audit: entries with accessCount == 0 and created > 90 days.
    Review for relevance. Re-tag, archive, or confirm still needed.
```

### On-Demand

User can trigger at any time with trigger keywords listed above.

### Post-Major-Change

After any of these events, suggest a health check (via Adjacent proactive type at task completion):
- KB restructuring (moving files, renaming protocols)
- Major save with 5+ new patterns or knowledge entries
- Index rebuild operations
- Version upgrades to memory.json or patterns.json schema

Note: This is a behavioral guideline, not an automated trigger. Relies on pattern recognition during task completion.

### Daily-Tasks Agenda Archival

- **Trigger**: Monthly maintenance or on-demand
- **Rule**: Agendas older than 7 days move to `Daily-Tasks/archive/`
- **Method**: `mv Daily-Tasks/agenda-YYYY-MM-DD.md Daily-Tasks/archive/`
- **Rationale**: Carryover items get pulled into next day's agenda. After 7 days, agendas are historical reference only.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not run CLEANUP-EXECUTE without HEALTH-CHECK first
- Do not skip the Destructive Action Gate before any Part 2 step
- Do not skip the verification pass (2g) after cleanup
- Do not modify index files without reading the corresponding data file first
- Do not run growth reduction (2e) without user confirmation
- Do not archive active projects without confirming status with user
- Do not invent retention thresholds; use memory-protocol.md as source of truth
- Do not treat this protocol as a replacement for save-time pruning (they complement)
- Do not flag files as orphans without completing the full 5-step verification in 2f

## Quick Reference

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `health check` | Non-destructive audit, reports issues |
| `full maintenance` | Health check + cleanup with confirmation |
| `integrity check` | Index-to-data sync verification only |
| `cleanup` | Execute cleanup on previously identified issues |
