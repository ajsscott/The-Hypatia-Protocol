|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Wall time (total) | Timestamp start/end of save | 148.3s |
| Wall time per step | Timestamp each of 9 steps | See save-protocol-benchmark.md |
| Files read during save | Count tool calls | 4 (~47,809 tokens) |
| Files written during save | Count tool calls | 5 (~49,328 tokens) |
| Bytes written | Sum file deltas | ~197 KB |
| Estimated tokens (read) | Bytes read / 4 | ~47,809 |
| Estimated tokens (written) | Bytes written / 4 | ~49,328 |
| Patterns captured | Count new + updated | 0 at save (2 mid-session) |

### Session Start Gate

| Metric | How Measured | Baseline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Indexes loaded | Count (should be 5) | 5 |
| Total index token cost | Sum of 5 index file sizes / 4 | ~30,022 tokens |
| memory-index.json | File size / 4 | ~2,633 tokens |

## Tier 2: Measurable with Minor Additions

These need small changes to how data is tracked but no new infrastructure.

### Protocol Activation

| Metric | What's Needed | Value |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Protocol trigger frequency | Log which protocols load per session during save | Which protocols fire most |
| Protocol load cost per trigger | File size of each protocol | Already known, need frequency |
| Gate fire rate | Count gate activations per session | How often each of 5 gates fires |
| Gate false positive rate | Track gate fires that didn't prevent an actual issue | Requires judgment call |

### Intelligence Quality

| Metric | What's Needed | Value |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Confidence drift over time | Track avg confidence per save | Is the system getting more or less confident? |
| Knowledge coverage by domain | Count entries per tag over time | Which domains are well-covered vs. sparse? |
| Reasoning synthesis rate | Track synthesized vs. stated per save | Is synthesis producing value? |
| Dedup hit rate | Count dedup catches during save | How often does new intelligence duplicate existing? |
| Access tracking (hot entries) | lastAccessed field analysis | Which entries get used most? |

### Proactive Behavior

| Metric | What's Needed | Value |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Offer accept rate by type | More offer_history entries (need more sessions) | Which offer types land? |
| Offers per session | Track in save | Staying under max 3? |
| Offer maturity stage | Assess against 4-stage model | Where is the system in its proactive evolution? |

### Session Efficiency

| Metric | What's Needed | Value |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Tokens per task type | Estimate by task complexity | Which tasks are token-expensive? |
| Context switches per session | Count topic changes | How fragmented are sessions? |
| Files touched per session | Count unique files read/written | Session scope indicator |

---

## Tier 3: Future / Aspirational

These would require new tooling or external measurement.

| Metric | What's Needed | Value |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Actual token usage per save | API-level token counter | True cost, not estimate |
| Actual token usage per session | API-level token counter | True session cost |
| Response latency | Timestamp request/response pairs | How fast is Hypatia? |
| Pattern prediction accuracy | Track predictions vs. outcomes systematically | Is confidence calibration working? |
| User satisfaction score | Explicit feedback mechanism | Quality signal |
| Cross-session learning transfer | Track when session N's learning helps session N+X | Compounding value measurement |
| Multi-user pattern isolation | Multiple users on same system | Enterprise readiness |
| Cold start vs. warm start time | Compare first message to mid-session | Init overhead |

### Security (Defense-in-Depth)

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Proxy URL filtering accuracy | Run test suite against BLOCKED patterns | 100% (0 FP, 0 FN) |
| Behavioral trigger catch rate | Test malicious content against triggers | >85% catch, <15% FP |
| Behavioral trigger false positive rate | Test legitimate content against triggers | <15% |
| Pattern count | Count regex patterns in BLOCKED list | Track growth |
| Trigger count | Count detection triggers in kernel | Track growth |

Note: Security benchmarks are in `security-benchmark-2026-03-22.md`. Proxy: 44/44 (100%, 0 FP). Triggers: 7/7 catch (100%), 0/9 FP (0%). Triggers are natural language (LLM-interpreted), not regex.

## Tier 4: Adversarial Interrogation Findings

Identified via adversarial interrogation of the benchmark suite itself (session 2026-03-21-006). Tests whether the benchmarks are testing the right things.

### Missing Coverage

| ID | Finding | Test Type | Priority |
|----|---------|-----------|----------|
| M1 | No dedicated reasoning retrieval behavioral test. Reasoning routes via reuse_signals/intents, not tags. Only tested as secondary store in Test 2. | Mechanical | High |
| M2 | No synonym map effectiveness test. 30 entries exist but no test verifies they improve retrieval. Inventory without behavior. | Mechanical | High |
| M3 | No HRF hybrid retrieval test. All retrieval tests are CSR-only. Don't know if HRF surfaces results CSR misses (the whole point of having it). | Mechanical | High |
| M4 | No save protocol correctness test. Timing/IO measured but not whether 4-layer capture system actually caught everything. | Observational | Medium |
| M5 | No proactive offering behavioral test. 11 trigger types, confidence thresholds, max-3 guardrail, but only metric is "1 offer logged." | Observational | Medium |
| M6 | No cross-session continuity test. Session index integrity checked (file existence) but not whether context actually carries forward. | Observational | Medium |

### Misconfigured Tests

| ID | Finding | Fix Type | Priority |
|----|---------|----------|----------|
| C1 | Test 10 (Memory Retrieval): Concluded "data sparsity, not routing failure" without verifying. Projects with multiple sessions and docs showing 0 memories needs investigation. | Retest with data | High |
| C2 | Test 12 (Confidence Calibration): Measures distribution shape, not calibration accuracy. 0.9 confidence should mean 90% correct. We measure compression, not correctness. | Redesign | Medium |
| C3 | Test 8 (Gate Coverage): Checks documentation, not behavior. Gates documented with triggers but no test that they actually fire during operation. | Add behavioral layer | High |

### False Confidence

| ID | Finding | Fix Type | Priority |
|----|---------|----------|----------|
| F1 | 100% tag reachability hides tag quality. Entry reachable via "runtime" but invisible for the likely query "eol" or "migration." Reachability ≠ findability. | Add quality test | Medium |
| F2 | 58.4% CSR savings is start-gate only. Session-long fetches add cost back. Reporting best-case without full picture. | Track full session | Low |
| F3 | 97.5% session success rate is self-assessed. No external validation. Missed items marked "success" are invisible. | Methodology note | Low |

### Methodology Gaps

| ID | Finding | Fix Type | Priority |
|----|---------|----------|----------|
| G1 | No regression tracking. Can't detect degradation between runs. A test that passes today and fails tomorrow is invisible. | Build comparison | Medium |
| G2 | No negative behavioral tests for protocols. Positive routing tested but not whether non-matching keywords correctly don't trigger. | Add negative tests | Medium |
| G3 | Growth rate projections assume linear growth. Intelligence capture rates likely change as system matures (diminishing returns, increasing dedup). | Methodology note | Low |

### Resolution Status

| ID | Status | Resolved In |
|----|--------|-------------|
| M1 | ✅ Added | behavioral-benchmark Test 14 |
| M2 | ✅ Added | behavioral-benchmark Test 15 |
| M3 | ✅ Added | behavioral-benchmark Test 16 |
| M4 | 📋 Tracked | Observational, test during live saves |
| M5 | 📋 Tracked | Observational, test during live sessions |
| M6 | 📋 Tracked | Observational, test during live sessions |
| C1 | ✅ Fixed | behavioral-benchmark Test 10 (reinvestigated) |
| C2 | ✅ Fixed | behavioral-benchmark Test 12 (renamed + methodology note) |
| C3 | 📋 Tracked | Observational, requires live gate firing observation |
| F1 | ✅ Added | behavioral-benchmark Test 17 |
| F2 | 📋 Tracked | Requires session-level token accounting |
| F3 | ✅ Fixed | behavioral-benchmark methodology section updated |
| G1 | 📋 Tracked | Future: automated regression comparison |
| G2 | ✅ Added | behavioral-benchmark Test 18 |
| G3 | ✅ Fixed | ecosystem-benchmark growth section updated |
